## Current State

Sprint 33 — Integrated Current-State Market Intelligence:

```text
CLOSED
```

A complete product alignment audit has been performed.

Phase 1 Package 1 establishes a provider-independent immutable instrument
identity contract and makes current portfolio holdings expose that contract
without changing their existing serialized JSON shape.

Phase 1 Package 2 adds explicit exchange, trading-calendar, and currency
metadata contracts and supports exchange-scoped ticker identity without
changing existing portfolio serialization.

Phase 1 Package 3 adds traceable market-metadata source provenance and
deterministic READY/PARTIAL/STALE quality assessment.

Phase 1 Package 4 adds provider-independent ETF characteristics and an
evidence envelope that preserves missing facts, source provenance, and quality.

Phase 1 Package 5 adds constituent-holding and categorical-exposure contracts
with explicit partial coverage, provenance, and quality.

Phase 1 is closed after verifying its complete roadmap scope and green CI.
Phase 2 Package 1 establishes immutable portfolio lifecycle transaction and
deterministically ordered ledger contracts without changing current snapshots.

Phase 2 Package 2 establishes append-only repository semantics and an in-memory
reference implementation with deterministic time and instrument queries.

Phase 2 Package 3 adds a versioned SQLite store and durable repository adapter
with immutable ledger metadata, strict JSON payloads, and rollback behavior.

Phase 2 Package 4 adds provider-neutral import batches and deterministic,
visible accounting for imported and duplicate transaction identities.

Phase 2 Package 5 adds a canonical provider-neutral transaction CSV schema,
line-specific validation, and lossless conversion into transaction import batches.

## Verified Product Direction

InvestmentTerminal is a personal investment intelligence platform.

Core flow:

```text
Market / external data
→ deterministic analysis
→ Review Package
→ immutable History
→ Knowledge
→ AI interpretation
→ explainable investment review
```

## Current Audit Conclusion

The architecture is suitable for further development.

Main missing product capabilities:

- multi-asset intelligence
- ETF intelligence
- transaction-based portfolio history
- portfolio risk/rebalancing
- macro/news context
- market discovery
- user interface
- broker integrations

Architecture redesign is not required.

## Working Protocol

Before every code package:

1. Read current files from GitHub.
2. Perform focused audit only for affected subsystem.
3. Analyze real repository state only.
4. Do not make assumptions.
5. Validate against PROJECT_VISION.md and architecture.
6. Provide complete changed files.
7. Update this checkpoint document.

After implementation:

- git add
- commit
- tests
- CI analysis after user confirmation.

## Latest Package

```text
Phase 2 Package 5 — Transaction CSV Parsing Boundary
```

Files:

```text
investment_terminal/portfolio/transaction_csv_parser.py
tests/test_transaction_csv_parser.py
DataModel.md
PROJECT_CONTINUATION.md
```

Source baseline verified against GitHub:

```text
develop @ 0791a244776b31591b95d1530626e029b47e3e4e
```

Architecture/product alignment:

- the CSV boundary is provider-neutral and requires one explicit canonical schema;
- UTF-8/BOM input, decimal comma, and ISO 8601 timezone offsets are supported;
- source row order and duplicate transaction evidence are preserved unchanged;
- instrument and transaction invariants remain owned by their domain models;
- repositories, lots, performance, and current snapshots remain unchanged.

## Current State

Sprint 33 — Integrated Current-State Market Intelligence:

```text
CLOSED
```

A complete product alignment audit has been performed.

Phase 1 Package 1 establishes a provider-independent immutable instrument
identity contract and makes current portfolio holdings expose that contract
without changing their existing serialized JSON shape.

Phase 1 Package 2 adds explicit exchange, trading-calendar, and currency
metadata contracts and supports exchange-scoped ticker identity without
changing existing portfolio serialization.

Phase 1 Package 3 adds traceable market-metadata source provenance and
deterministic READY/PARTIAL/STALE quality assessment.

Phase 1 Package 4 adds provider-independent ETF characteristics and an
evidence envelope that preserves missing facts, source provenance, and quality.

Phase 1 Package 5 adds constituent-holding and categorical-exposure contracts
with explicit partial coverage, provenance, and quality.

Phase 1 is closed after verifying its complete roadmap scope and green CI.
Phase 2 Package 1 establishes immutable portfolio lifecycle transaction and
deterministically ordered ledger contracts without changing current snapshots.

## Verified Product Direction

InvestmentTerminal is a personal investment intelligence platform.

Core flow:

```text
Market / external data
→ deterministic analysis
→ Review Package
→ immutable History
→ Knowledge
→ AI interpretation
→ explainable investment review
```

## Current Audit Conclusion

The architecture is suitable for further development.

Main missing product capabilities:

- multi-asset intelligence
- ETF intelligence
- transaction-based portfolio history
- portfolio risk/rebalancing
- macro/news context
- market discovery
- user interface
- broker integrations

Architecture redesign is not required.

## Working Protocol

Before every code package:

1. Read current files from GitHub.
2. Perform focused audit only for affected subsystem.
3. Analyze real repository state only.
4. Do not make assumptions.
5. Validate against PROJECT_VISION.md and architecture.
6. Provide complete changed files.
7. Update this checkpoint document.

After implementation:

- git add
- commit
- tests
- CI analysis after user confirmation.

```

Architecture/product alignment:

- Portfolio owns lifecycle transactions; History ownership is unchanged;
- BUY/SELL/DIVIDEND/FEE semantics are explicit and immutable;
- occurrence timestamps are timezone-aware and settlement currency is explicit;
- ledger identity, transaction uniqueness, and deterministic order are enforced;
- persistence, imports, lots, performance, and current snapshots remain unchanged.
